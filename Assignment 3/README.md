# Feature Engineering for Book Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on feature engineering techniques within the context of machine learning, transforming raw data into informative features that enhance model performance and interpretability. It emphasizes data preprocessing, feature creation, and assessing the effects of these processes on predictive outcomes.

## Objectives
- Understand and apply various feature engineering techniques.
- Explore methods for selecting and creating relevant features.
- Assess the impact of preprocessing on model performance beyond mere accuracy.

## Data Description
The dataset used for this project is a Book Price dataset containing key attributes of various books. Each entry includes the following features:
- **Title**: Unique identifier for each book.
- **Author**: The writer(s), influencing perceptions and marketability.
- **Edition**: Specific version details, impacting rarity and desirability.
- **Reviews**: User feedback indicating popularity.
- **Ratings**: Scores reflecting quality given by readers.
- **Synopsis**: Summary of the book's content.
- **Genre**: Category of the book.
- **BookCategory**: Broader classification context.
- **Price**: Target variable for prediction.

## Tasks Overview
The assignment emphasizes the following tasks related to feature engineering and data preprocessing:

### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Identify and manage missing values, and handle outliers effectively.
- **Scaling and Normalization**: Apply techniques to ensure features are on a similar scale, essential for many machine learning algorithms.
- **Categorical Variable Handling**: Use methods like one-hot encoding and label encoding to convert categorical data into formats suitable for model training.

### Feature Creation
- **New Feature Generation**: Explore techniques for creating additional features from existing ones, including:
  - **Polynomial Features**: Generate new features based on polynomial combinations of existing features.
  - **Interaction Features**: Capture interactions between different variables.
  - **Domain-Specific Engineering**: Tailor features based on domain knowledge.
  - **Feature Extraction**: Extract meaningful features from unstructured data, such as text analysis of the book synopsis.

### Implementation
- While using a specific machine learning model (e.g., `RandomForestRegressor`) is part of the project, the focus is on the effectiveness of the preprocessing pipeline rather than model accuracy. A provided code skeleton serves as a starting point for implementing the feature engineering process.

### Reporting
- Prepare a detailed report outlining the methods and techniques used throughout the project. This report should:
  - Discuss preprocessing steps and their impact on the data.
  - Explain the logic behind feature engineering choices.
  - Include visualizations (without code) to illustrate findings and insights gained from the data.

## Data Preprocessing Steps Involved
1. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values and outliers.
2. **Scaling, Normalization, and Standardization**: Ensure consistent feature scales for improved model performance.
3. **Handling Categorical Variables**: Utilize techniques such as one-hot encoding and label encoding.

## Feature Engineering & Transformation
- **Feature Creation**: Explore techniques like polynomial features, interaction features, and domain-specific engineering. Implement text feature extraction methods, particularly from the synopsis.
- **Authors Analysis**: Clean and standardize author data to a uniform format.
- **Edition Analysis**: Extract meaningful attributes from the edition information.
- **Popularity Column**: Create a weighted value of ratings to assess book popularity.
- **Handling Null Values**: Fill missing values with the mode of each column.
- **Normalization**: Adjust features like reviews and ratings to a common scale for better visualization.

## Visualization
- Use various visualization techniques (e.g., bar plots, box plots) to analyze numerical and categorical features.
- Generate a correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.

## Implementation
- Utilize a specified model (e.g., `RandomForestRegressor`) for training and prediction.
- Evaluate the preprocessing pipeline rather than model accuracy, highlighting the significance of feature engineering.

## Results
- Present the impact of preprocessing techniques on model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.
- Analyze feature importance from the Random Forest model to identify the most influential features.

## Conclusion
This project reinforces the importance of robust feature engineering and preprocessing in machine learning. It highlights the necessity of transforming raw data into meaningful features and the impact of these transformations on predictive models. Through this work, students gain practical experience in applying techniques that enhance data usability and model interpretability.
