# EDA & Data Visualization Assignment

## Overview
This assignment focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization to understand the multifaceted impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The goal is to clean the dataset, analyze trends and patterns, and present findings through insightful visualizations.

## Objectives

### Data Cleaning
- Removed outliers and effectively handled null values.
- Ensured the dataset is in a suitable format for analysis, including addressing possible duplicate entries based on date and location.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted a thorough analysis of the cleaned data to uncover trends, correlations, and insights related to the pandemic.
- Focused on key metrics such as excess mortality, testing rates, and socio-economic factors.
- Employed clustering techniques to identify distinct groups of countries based on human development indices and reproduction rates.

### Creative Visualization
- Developed innovative visualizations that extend beyond basic charts and graphs, capturing the evolving dynamics of COVID-19 across countries.
- Utilized various tools and techniques to illustrate patterns, including geographic heatmaps and dynamic scatterplots.
